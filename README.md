- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

There were many things I didn't know how to do yet when I started this project,
but through the power of Google and my instructors, I was able to piece together
what I needed to do. The biggest struggle was learning how to round the corners of the outside corners, but not round the inside corners (where the cards came together).

```css
.row {
    display: flex;
    border-radius: 8px;
    overflow: hidden;
    max-width: 65vw;
    min-height: 65vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I definitely need to get better at taking notes of the things I try and what works and doesn't work, so that I can cut down on experimentation time, make writing READMEs easier, and better understand and retain what I'm doing for the future.
